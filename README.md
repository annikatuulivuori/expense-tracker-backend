# 💸 Expense Tracker (backend)

This is a backend for a TypeScript React learning project. The purpose of this project was to learn more about backend development and to try making a project with Spring Boot.

Project was initialized using spring initializr (https://start.spring.io/)

## 📦 Technologies 
- `Java`
- `Spring Boot`

## ✨ Featrures

This expense tracker is quite simple. In the frontend you can (for now) add new expenses. Every expense has a description and an amount. 
All expenses will be stored in a list within the backend. As of right now, the expenses added will not save for later. 

Backend also has fuctionality for deleting a single expense (frontend does not).

## 📚 Goals I had for this project

Before starting this project, I knew I had goals to learn new skills. Here is a list of detailed list of what I wanted to achieve:

- learn to use Spring Boot in a project
- gain more understanging in RESTful API design and implementation
- practice error handling and logging

**Did I achieve these goals?** Short answer is yes, kind of. Long asnwer is that this project is not perfect - and it shows. Error handling is not where I would like it to be. There are also no test done and I would like to learn more about the file structure in Spring Boot projects.

## 💭 How can this project be improved?

- input validation and more error handling
- integration with a database to store expenses
- add different categories for expenses

## 🖼️ What it looks like
